# HTML Advanced Project

This is the **initial version** of my **first project at Holberton School**.  
It currently contains **only the HTML structure**, but it is the foundation for a full web project that will later include **CSS styling and responsive design**.

## 📂 Project Structure

The project is divided into **three main parts**:

### 🔹 Header

- a **clickable logo**
- **three clickable navigation links**

### 🔹 Main

The `<main>` tag contains **five semantic sections**:

1. **Banner** – with a heading, text, and button
2. **Quote** – with a blockquote and author text
3. **Videos** – showing 4 professional profiles with images and descriptions
4. **Membership** – includes CTA elements
5. **FAQ** – frequently asked questions section

These sections are well-structured and organized with semantic HTML5 tags.

### 🔹 Footer

- project logo
- contact information (with image links and text)

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal is to build a **clean and accessible semantic HTML structure**, which will be **styled later using CSS**.
